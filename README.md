# Evolve Exploits
Dragonfruit is an exploit dedicated to Evolve on ROBLOX. It includes multiple features, such as:
- Moderator detection
- Use touch abilities through anywhere
- Eat any food on the map
- Spoof creature speed
- Flying, floating
...

**Usage**
```lua
-- Don't execute more than once. It will take time to load the UI because of obfuscation
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharpcystals-github342/Dragonfruit/refs/heads/main/DragonfruitLoader.lua"))()
```

## Planned Updates - Evolve
**Possess**

- An OP feature, that when your player grabs control of another creature eg. Using mandible or host, You can choose one of their body parts like a Lance, or damage things, or even their mouths that can eat to touch another person, eat another food orb, touch a random pillar, or even damage their lances on a rock, or touch a DNA crystal, make them parry another person, give them the hell damage of all medusas on the map, or make them despawn by making them touch the baseplate client side, or even make them go into silklocks

**Bypass speed anticheat**

- The flying thing will bypass the speed anticheat, and maybe the spoof creature speed one too

**Destroy pillars on maps**

- This is in WIP

**Control creature**

- Just literally fly someone's creature like a pilot. That's all

**Rotate creature**

- Rotate your ingame creature to 90ยบ or more and walk like that.

**Become ball**

- Basically lose control of your creature, and then become a rolling ball others can push

**Spoof Jet**

- Have a Jet button, and you can activate it whenever you want. (Bypasses anticheat)

**Flip creature upside down**

- Flips someone upside down

**Spectate creature**

- Spectate a creature from anywhere by setting your camera to it.

**Execute Infinite Yield**

- Starts the Infinite Yield script for some extra movement stuff

**Fall underground**

- Disable map collisions and fall into the void, instead of using the instant despawn creature. It's like the noclip gone wrong, but intentional.

**Check player's food capacity**

- If possible, check the stats of a player to see how much food they have left in their food storage
