# Evolve Exploits
Dragonfruit is an exploit dedicated to Evolve on ROBLOX. It includes multiple features, such as:
- Moderator detection
- Use touch abilities through anywhere
- Eat any food on the map
- Spoof creature speed
.. and more soon

**Usage**
```lua
-- Don't execute more than once. It will take time to load
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharpcystals-github342/Dragonfruit/refs/heads/main/DragonfruitLoader.lua"))()
```

## Planned Updates - Evolve
**Bypass speed anticheat**

- The flying thing will bypass the speed anticheat, and maybe the spoof creature speed one too

**Destroy pillars on maps**

- This is in WIP

**Control creature**

- Just literally fly someone's creature like a pilot. That's all

**Rotate creature**

- Rotate your ingame creature to 90ยบ or more and walk like that.

**Become ball**

- Basically lose control of your creature, and then become a rolling ball others can push

**Spoof Jet**

- Have a Jet button, and you can activate it whenever you want. (Bypasses anticheat)

**Flip creature upside down**

- Flips someone upside down

**Spectate creature**

- Spectate a creature from anywhere by setting your camera to it.

**Execute Infinite Yield**

- Starts the Infinite Yield script

**Fall underground**

- Disable map collisions and fall into the void, instead of using the instant despawn creature. It's like the noclip gone wrong, but intentional.

**Check player's food capacity**

- If possible, check the stats of a player to see how much food they have left in their food storage

## Tip
If the Dragonfruit bootstrapper freezes on loading, and the progress bar doesn't progress: Try re-executing the script
